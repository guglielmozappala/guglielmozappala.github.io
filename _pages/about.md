I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the Paris School of Economics. I am also a research fellow at IC Migrations. 

I study the socio-economic impact of climate change, as well as how individuals perceive and form their attitudes towards climate and perceive and the role of perceptions in adaptive behavior.
