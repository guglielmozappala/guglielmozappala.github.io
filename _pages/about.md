I am a PhD candidate at the Paris School of Economics and a research fellow at IC Migrations. <br>

My research focuses on the socio-economic impact of climate change and the human ability to adapt to these impacts, as well as how individuals perceive and form their attitudes towards climate and the role of beliefs in adaptive behavior. <br>

As part of the European Doctoral Programme (EDP), in 2023 I visited the London School of Economics and the Grantham Research Institute. In 2022, I have been a visiting research scholar at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. <br>
