I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Berkeley in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. <br>

My research focuses on the socio-economic impact of climate change and the human ability to adapt to these impacts, as well as how individuals perceive and form their attitudes towards climate and the role of beliefs in adaptive behavior. <br>

I obtained my PhD in Economics at the Paris School of Economics in 2023. My dissertation was awarded the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from the [European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists](https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award) and the Best Dissertation Award from the [French Economic Association (AFSE)](https://www.afse.fr/fr/news/laureats-du-prix-de-these-de-l-afse-2024-2356?langue_selected=fr). <br>

I am on the 2024/2025 job market. <br>
