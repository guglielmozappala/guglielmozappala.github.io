I am an Environmental Fellow at Harvard University. <br>

My research focuses on the socio-economic impacts of climate change and humanity’s ability to adapt to these impacts, with particular interest in the role of individual beliefs and of public policies in shaping adaptive behavior. Part of my research also examines the determinants of environmental preferences and of public support for climate policies. <br>

I obtained my PhD in Economics at the Paris School of Economics in 2023. My dissertation was awarded the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from the [European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists](https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award) and from the [French Economic Association (AFSE)](https://www.afse.fr/fr/news/laureats-du-prix-de-these-de-l-afse-2024-2356?langue_selected=fr). <br>

Prior to joining Harvard, I held (pre-market) postdoctoral positions at UC Berkeley (Agricultural and Resource Economics) and UC Santa Barbara (emLab - Bren School).  <br>

In Fall 2026, I will join Bocconi University as an Assistant Professor. <br>
