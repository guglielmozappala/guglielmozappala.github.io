I am a second-year PhD candidate in Economics at the Paris School of Economics and a research fellow at IC Migrations. 

From March to June 2022, I am a visiting research student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, sponsored by Prof. Tamma Carleton.

My research focuses on the socio-economic impact of climate change, as well as how individuals perceive and form their attitudes towards climate and the role of perceptions in adaptive behavior.
