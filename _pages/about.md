I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Berkeley in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. <br>

My research focuses on the socio-economic impacts of climate change and humanityâ€™s ability to adapt to these impacts, with particular interest in the role of individual beliefs and of public policies in shaping adaptive behavior. Part of my research also examines the determinants of environmental preferences and of public support for climate policies. <br>

I obtained my PhD in Economics at the Paris School of Economics in 2023. My dissertation was awarded the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from the [European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists](https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award) and from the [French Economic Association (AFSE)](https://www.afse.fr/fr/news/laureats-du-prix-de-these-de-l-afse-2024-2356?langue_selected=fr). <br>

In summer 2025, I will join Harvard University as a Postdoctoral Researcher, and after that, Bocconi University as an Assistant Professor.
