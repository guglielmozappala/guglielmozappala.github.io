### Do subjective perceptions shape adaptation to climate change? Evidence from Bangladesh
[Draft available upon request]

_Abstract_ : This paper examines how subjective perceptions of climate change influence adaptation decisions. Combining a survey of rural households in Bangladesh with a meteorological measure of dryness, I study the effect of subjective perceptions of increases in droughts on the use of irrigation. I formalize a theoretical framework in which the effect of subjective perceptions is moderated by the average long-term excess dryness relative to historical averages. I empirically test the implications and document that the effect is stronger for more severe environmental conditions and heterogeneous across growing seasons, types of irrigation and socio-demographic characteristics of farmers. I further explore three mechanisms through which cognitive factors may affect adaptation decisions. Exploiting the intensity and the frequency of drought events, I compare self-reported and objective records. The findings show that farmers only adjust their irrigation decisions as a response to previous year's self-reported drought events, and inaccuracy in their occurrence leads to potentially sub-optimal irrigation decisions, reducing the share of irrigated land. I also provide evidence that overestimating the frequency of past droughts explains differences in irrigation.

### Drought exposure and accuracy: Motivated reasoning in climate change beliefs
[Draft available upon request]

_Abstract_ : Despite scientific consensus, there is no unanimity among individuals in the beliefs about climate change. Understanding how people form these beliefs and what drives their interpretation of climatic events is essential, especially in developing countries and among agricultural communities, which may most suffer the consequences of climate change. Using survey data from rural households in Bangladesh together with a meteorological measure of excess dryness relative to historical averages, this paper studies how long-term average exposure to dryness and short-term deviations shape belief formation and the recollection of drought events. To explore how agents interpret past drought events, I use an instrumental variable approach and investigate whether individual beliefs lead to distortions of objective information in an asymmetric manner. The results show that the probability and the extent to which individuals overestimate the number of past drought events are significantly biased in the direction of their prior beliefs, providing suggestive evidence of directional motivated reasoning. The findings highlight the need for models that account for behavioral factors to study climate change beliefs and their implications for effective communication and adaptation policies. 

## Climate-induced migration and environmental policy preferences
[Draft available upon request]

_Abstract_ : In the last decades, climate change has engendered an increase in migration. This paper examines the consequences of recent waves of asylum applications in the European Union induced by weather fluctuations on the demand and supply of environmental policy preferences. I combine survey data with parties' agenda and electoral outcomes, and exploit exogenous variation in weather in non-OECD origin countries to derive a gravity-predicted instrument for asylum applications between 2000 and 2019. I find that asylum applications induced by weather variations increase the individual demand to treat climate change as a priority in the political arena. Relying on within-country variation across cohorts, I further document that the effect is larger among young generations and among birth-cohorts exposed to larger flows during their formative age. On the supply side, I find that national parties shift their political agenda, being more attentive to the environment. Instead, weather-induced asylum applications negatively affect votes for green parties in the European Parliament elections, driving a drop out of the voting polls of traditional green voters, but positively affect the environmentalism in national elections.
