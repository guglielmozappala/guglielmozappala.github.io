[**Drought exposure and accuracy: Motivated reasoning in climate change beliefs**](/files/Zappala_FAERE_WP2022.02.pdf) <em> [R&R Environmental and Resource Economics] FAERE Working Paper, 2022.02</em> <br/>

The lack of vigorous policies to avert significant climate change has increased the importance for effective and timely adaptation. Adequate adaptation is particularly important for agricultural communities in developing countries, which may most suffer the consequences of climate change. Evidence is still scarce on how people from the most vulnerable areas form climate change beliefs and whether they exhibit cognitive biases. Using survey data from rural households in Bangladesh together with a meteorological measure of excess dryness relative to historical averages, I study how long-term average drought exposure and short-term deviations shape beliefs about drought frequency and the interpretation of drought events. To explore how agents interpret past droughts, I use an instrumental variable approach and investigate whether individual beliefs lead to asymmetric distortion of objective information. The results show that individuals recollect and overweight evidence tilted towards their prior beliefs, providing evidence of confirmation bias as a directional motivated reasoning mechanism. The findings highlight the need for models that account for behavioral factors to study climate change beliefs and their implications for effective communication and adaptation policies.

<br>
Mounting evidence that climate is changing requires a better understanding of how individuals adapt, in particular for communities that rely on agricultural activities in developing countries. Combining a survey of rural households in Bangladesh with a meteorological measure of dryness, I study the role of subjective perceptions of climate change on irrigation use. I formalize a theoretical framework of behavioral inattention to examine how farmers' beliefs differentially shape their responsiveness to dryness exposure. I empirically test the implications and document that the effect is stronger for more severe environmental conditions, with heterogeneous responses by growing seasons, types of irrigation and socio-demographic characteristics. I further explore three cognitive mechanisms, exploiting the intensity and the frequency of drought events and comparing self-reported and objective records. In a counterfactual analysis with beliefs based on meteorological conditions, I document that farmers underuse irrigation and incur substantial monetary losses as a result of inaccurate beliefs, generating a belief gap.

**Climate-induced migration and environmental values** <br/> [Draft available upon request]

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Weather fluctuations can substantially affect international migration, however, little is known about the political consequences of the climate-driven portion of migration flows in the host countries. This paper examines the effect of recent waves of asylum seeker flows induced by weather fluctuations on the demand and supply of environmental policy preferences in the European Union. I combine survey data with parties' agenda and electoral outcomes, and exploit exogenous variation in weather in non-OECD origin countries to derive a gravity-predicted instrument for asylum applications between 2000 and 2019. On the demand side, I document that flows induced by weather fluctuations raise individual concern on climate change as a priority in the political arena. Relying on within-country variation across cohorts, I find a positive effect for individuals exposed to larger asylum flows during their formative age. On the supply side, I find that national parties shift their political agenda towards the environment. Focusing on electoral outcomes, weather-induced asylum applications negatively affect votes for green parties in the European Parliament elections, which can be explained by a drop out of the voting polls of traditional green voters and by changes in preferences for individuals yet below the voting age.

**Sectoral impact and propagation of weather shocks** <br/> [Draft coming soon]

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Local weather shocks have been shown to affect local economic output, however, little is known about their propagation through production networks. Using a six-sector global dataset over the past fifty years, this paper examines the effect of weather fluctuations and extreme weather events on sectoral economic production and the transmission of weather shocks across sectors, countries and over time. I document that agriculture is the most harmed sector by heat shocks, droughts and cyclones. Using input-output interlinkages, I find that sectors at later stages of the supply chain suffer from substantial and persistent losses over time due to domestic and foreign heat shocks in other sectors, mostly propagating downstream. A counterfactual analysis of the average annual output loss accounting for heat shocks across trade partners shows a substantial underestimation of the economic cost due to temperature increases since 2000.
