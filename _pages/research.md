<br>
The lack of vigorous policies to avert significant climate change has increased the importance for effective and timely adaptation. Adequate adaptation is particularly important for agricultural communities in developing countries, which may most suffer the consequences of climate change. Evidence is still scarce on how people from the most vulnerable areas form climate change beliefs and whether they exhibit cognitive biases. Using survey data from rural households in Bangladesh together with a meteorological measure of excess dryness relative to historical averages, I study how long-term average drought exposure and short-term deviations shape beliefs about drought frequency and the interpretation of drought events. To explore how agents interpret past droughts, I use an instrumental variable approach and investigate whether individual beliefs lead to asymmetric distortion of objective information. The results show that individuals recollect and overweight evidence tilted towards their prior beliefs, providing evidence of confirmation bias as a directional motivated reasoning mechanism. The findings highlight the need for models that account for behavioral factors to study climate change beliefs and their implications for effective communication and adaptation policies.

**Do subjective perceptions shape adaptation to climate change? Evidence from Bangladesh** <br/> [Draft available upon request]

Mounting evidence that climate is changing requires a better understanding of how individuals adapt, in particular for communities that rely on agricultural activities in developing countries. Combining a survey of rural households in Bangladesh with a meteorological measure of dryness, I study the role of subjective perceptions of climate change on irrigation use. I formalize a theoretical framework of behavioral inattention to examine how farmers' beliefs differentially shape their responsiveness to dryness exposure. I empirically test the implications and document that the effect is stronger for more severe environmental conditions, with heterogeneous responses by growing seasons, types of irrigation and socio-demographic characteristics. I further explore three cognitive mechanisms, exploiting the intensity and the frequency of drought events and comparing self-reported and objective records. In a counterfactual analysis with beliefs based on meteorological conditions, I document that farmers underuse irrigation and incur substantial monetary losses as a result of inaccurate beliefs, generating a belief gap.

**Climate-induced migration and environmental values** <br/> [Draft available upon request]

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
In the last decades, climate change has engendered an increase in migration. This paper examines the consequences of recent waves of asylum applications in the European Union induced by weather fluctuations on the demand and supply of environmental policy preferences. I combine survey data with parties' agenda and electoral outcomes, and exploit exogenous variation in weather in non-OECD origin countries to derive a gravity-predicted instrument for asylum applications between 2000 and 2019. I find that asylum applications induced by weather variations increase the individual demand to treat climate change as a priority in the political arena. Relying on within-country variation across cohorts, I further document that the effect is larger among young generations and among birth-cohorts exposed to larger flows during their formative age. On the supply side, I find that national parties shift their political agenda, being more attentive to the environment. Instead, weather-induced asylum applications negatively affect votes for green parties in the European Parliament elections, driving a drop out of the voting polls of traditional green voters, but positively affect the environmentalism in national elections.
