[**Propagation of extreme heat in agriculture across sectors and space**](/files/zappala_jmp.pdf) <br/> 
(An earlier version circulated as ["Sectoral impact and propagation of weather shocks"](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/03/10/Sectoral-Impact-and-Propagation-of-Weather-Shocks-530798), _IMF Working Paper, 2023/053_)  <br/>

<br>
Agriculture is widely recognized as one of the sectors most vulnerable to extreme temperatures. Yet, crop losses are estimated to form only a modest share of aggregate macroeconomic damages from climate change, since agriculture accounts for a small share of global GDP. These estimates, however, arise from analyses that largely ignore the critical role of agriculture as an upstream sector in global production networks, including the sectoral and spatial linkages connecting local agricultural output to other sectors and regions. In this paper, I develop a novel reduced form method to incorporate input linkages between sectors and countries that I use to estimate the aggregate impacts of extreme heat in agriculture. A multi-region multi-sector production network model illustrates how extreme heat in agriculture can propagate to downstream sectors across countries by reducing supply availability and increasing intermediate input prices. Exploiting the geographic distribution and temperature sensitivity of 118 crops across the world, I construct a measure of exposure to extreme heat in agriculture and show that it induces substantial losses to downstream sectors, across national borders, and beyond first degree linkages. Counterfactual exercises reveal that input linkages are responsible for approximately 70% of the total value added losses induced by extreme heat in agriculture. The analysis additionally demonstrates the critical role of countries that are central to global production networks, suggesting that local benefits from adaptation in such regions can have substantial co-benefits downstream and in other locations.

[**Endogenous green preferences**](/files/VZ_Endogenous_green_preferences.pdf) (with [Ravi Vora](https://sites.google.com/view/ravi-vora-)) <br/>

<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Stringent environmental policies often lack public support. But after policies are enacted, do individual preferences about them change? Using surveys covering 38 countries around the world, we study the effect of exposure to environmental policies on policy preferences. Exploiting within-country-year, across birth-cohort variation, we find that individuals exposed to more stringent environmental policies during early adulthood are more supportive of environmental policies later on in life. This relationship suggests that a society's environmental policy attitudes evolve endogenously, with implications for choosing measures, forecasting their path over time, and evaluating their normative appropriateness.

[**Climate-induced migration and environmental values**](/files/zappala_migration_values.pdf) <br/>

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Climate awareness is crucial for garnering support for climate policies. While prior work highlights socio-political factors and local weather experiences as determinants of climate concern, this paper formulates a novel mechanism: exposure to the socio-economic consequences of climate change. I test this hypothesis using climate-induced migration inflows, which can reduce the psychological distance of climate shocks or raise the perceived costs of climate inaction. Focusing on asylum seekers displaced by extreme temperatures and precipitation in non-OECD countries and arriving in the European Union between 2000 and 2019, I construct a gravity-predicted instrument combining exogenous weather variation and bilateral measures of migration costs. I find that weather-driven asylum demands significantly increase public climate concern in host countries, ruling out alternative channels such as media coverage and trade. The effect is driven by right-leaning and less-educated voters, suggesting that heightened concern reflects an increase in perceived salience and cost of climate inaction rather than a broad increase in climate awareness. Shifts in stated preferences, however, do not translate into pro-environmental voting, consistent with turnout effects, non-voter preference changes, and stable party platforms.

[**Co-benefits of substance abuse regulation on temperature and violent crime**](/files/PZ_substances.pdf) (with [Filippo Pavanello](https://fpavanello.github.io/)) <br/>

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Higher temperatures can increase substance abuse and exacerbate its physiological effects on the human body, raising the risk of violent behavior. Using administrative crime records and daily temperatures in the United States between 1991 and 2023, we show that two public policies regulating substance abuse --- the expansion of substance abuse treatment facilities and the reformulation of the prescription opioid OxyContin --- substantially moderate the impact of temperature on interpersonal violent crime. We monetize the policy benefits for intimate partner violence, the most widespread crime in the United States, and show that substance abuse regulations can be a cost-effective tool for climate adaptation.
